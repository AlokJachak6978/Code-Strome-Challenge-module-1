# 🧠 Codestrom Challenge: Module 1 (Python Fundamentals)

Welcome to **Module 1 of the Codestrom Challenge**!  
This notebook is part of a hands-on assessment that covers core Python concepts through a series of well-structured problems designed to test your understanding and logic-building skills.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This challenge is part of the **Introduction to Computer Programming** series and focuses on evaluating key programming skills using Python.

You’ll explore:

- Data types, slicing, and indexing  
- Conditional logic and loops  
- String and number manipulation  
- Custom functions and logic implementation  
- Object-Oriented Programming and Exception Handling  

---

## 📚 Skills Covered

To succeed in this module, you will need:

- ✅ Python syntax fundamentals  
- ✅ Use of built-in functions and operators  
- ✅ Indexing and slicing techniques  
- ✅ Loops (`for`, `while`) and conditionals (`if-else`)  
- ✅ Exception handling with `try-except`  
- ✅ Dictionary, string, list, and set operations  
- ✅ Writing clean, efficient code with comments  
- ✅ OOP concepts like classes and methods  

---

## 📂 Deliverables

You are required to submit:

- ✔️ A Jupyter notebook solving **30 Python coding questions**  
- ✔️ Code that is **well-commented** and **modular**  
- ✔️ A **video explanation** (external link) for **any 5 chosen questions**  
- ✔️ Clearly stated **problem statements and solutions**  

---

## ✅ Sample Problems Solved

A few types of problems included:

- 🔁 Reverse a number **without using built-in functions**  
- 🔍 Check if the **binary representation of a number is a palindrome**  
- 🔠 Count the **most frequent character** in a string  
- 📏 Convert a **list of words into their lengths**  
- 📊 Use dictionaries to **track and retrieve maximum values**  
- 🔢 Work with **binary and numeric formatting**  
- 🧰 Create **custom classes and use exception handling**

---

## 💻 How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone this repo or download the notebook file.
2. Open it in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
3. Run each code cell step-by-step.
4. Modify inputs to test logic and edge cases.

---

## 🎥 Video Explanation (Optional)

Participants must create a video explaining any 5 questions:

- Clearly explain the **problem statement**
- Walk through your **logic and code**
- Provide a link in the notebook or repo (optional)

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- Built-in Modules: `string`, `sys`, etc.
